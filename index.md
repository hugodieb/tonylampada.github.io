## 1. Who am I

I am a Brazilian software engineer and have been programming professionally since 2000. My motto is "solve problems and help people".
So if you're ever in a pinch and need some tech advice or help, feel free to find me on whatsapp and I'll do what I can to help.

I'm easy to work with. I take my job very seriously but I prefer to work in more relaxed and playful environments, and I do what I can to provide that kind of environment to people who work with me.

Last but not least, I'm a 35 husband and father of a little boy called Thomas.

## 2. What I can do

* I can do other things but I have worked most of my life with web development (and some devops more recently). My favorite stack for webdev is Postgres, AWS, Docker, Python, Django and AngularJS (1.x) or VueJs.
* I can put together modern web applications and **scalably** deploy them - in an automated fashion - to production environments in the cloud with **zero downtime**.
* I can organize the development proccess for your team, and apply the right tools to make development and breeze both for front-end and back-end.
* I can design and understand business processes, and I can *help* with project management and bring a set of management best practices that tends to make everyone deliver better results consistently.
* I can teach/train people on back-end and front-end development and devops tools and practices and I try my best motivate and influence people to be better programmers.
* I've also done some recent work with machine learning and data science. I'm not nearly as good with that as with web development, but I think there's good potential on that area for me too.

## 3. What I can't do

* Be a full time project manager. I love the **building part** too much for that.
* Write good, working CSS code  - a frustration that I hope I'll overcome some day. Right now I usually need a CSS-ninja to work with me.

## 4. What do I like

I believe software is **a form of art** and I care a lot for the "inner quality" of the software I build. Things like unit testing, good architecture, well-designed APIs matter a lot to me.

I'm passionate about open source, and that led me to create [freedomsponsors.org](http://freedomsponsors.org). I wish I had more time to dedicate to FS and open source in general.

## 5. Things I did that you can see online

* [Freedomsponsors](https://freedomsponsors.org) - A crowdfunding platform for Free and Open Source software.
* [Djangular3](https://github.com/tonylampada/djangular3) - A reusable web-project template using Django and AngularJS (README is in portuguese, but there's a [setup instructions video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okWBei-rK_A&feature=youtu.be) in english as well)
* [tlvuestarter](https://github.com/tonylampada/tlvuestarter) - A [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) starter template, featuring [mock-apis](https://medium.com/@tonylampada/javascript-mock-api-why-you-might-want-to-have-one-232b3ba46b12#.x73b44qmt) and a [component catalog](https://medium.com/@tonylampada/component-catalog-why-you-might-want-to-have-one-72ee1dc1f6b1#.nt4v0zen0).
* [webgl_graphs](http://tonylampada.github.io/webgl_graphs/) - Playing with webgl (3D rendering in the browser). This toy-tool lets you see graphs in 3D that obey simple attraction/repulsion rules.
* [Javascript for grownups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iabZob_YEKg&t=13m40s) - Recording of a 3h webinar teaching javascript to random people from different parts of the world.
